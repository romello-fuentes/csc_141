# 4-14, pep8, Pg 103

'''This exercise is about PEP 8, the official Python style guide.
PEP 8 provides rules for writing clean, consistent, and readable code.
Some of the key points include: using 4 spaces for indentation, keeping
lines under 79 characters, writing clear comments and docstrings, and
following naming conventions like snake_case for functions and variables.
Following PEP 8 makes programs easier to read, maintain, and share. '''
